# /etc/init/workers.conf - manage a set of Sidekiqs

# Based on:
# https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Deploying-to-Ubuntu
# https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/tree/master/examples/upstart

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See sidekiq.conf for how to manage a single Sidekiq instance.
#
# Use "stop workers" to stop all Sidekiq instances.
# Use "start workers" to start all instances.
# Use "restart workers" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
